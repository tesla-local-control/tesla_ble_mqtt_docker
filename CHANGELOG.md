DO NOT UPGRADE PRIOR TO READ THE BELOW UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS, SEE AFTER LIST OF CHANGES<br>
WARNING WARNING WARNING</p>

- NEW Feature: Support for unlimited cars (VINs + MAC Addrs)
- NEW Setting: BLE Proximity Detection TTL; helps reduce false negative presence with sporadic BLE advertisement (0 to disable)
- NEW Feature: Added "debug" entity which sends only one charge amps command: Issue [#19](https://github.com/tesla-local-control/tesla_ble_mqtt_core/issues/19)
- NEW Feature: Device's cards and buttons are made visible based on logic that takes into account the state of generated keys, sent and accepted public key by the vehicle.
- NEW Setting: Presence Detection Loop Delay (how often to check the presence of your car(s))
- NEW Setting: Toggle to enable/disable Home Assistant Features (Standalone version only)
- CHG: Improved presence detection reliability (using car's MAC addr and BLE Local Name)
- CHG: Added retry functionality on MQTT publish failure (service/network issue)
- CHG: Rename entities for consistency & better wording (see table below)
- CHG: Code Quality Linting (shellcheck & shfmt) [ @epenet ]
- CHG: Support bashio::log w/ timestamp (HA add-on)
- CHG: Reduce logging; Improved colors consistency; More to be removed in next release
- CHG: Add bluez-deprecated pkg (ciptool hciattach hciconfig hcidump hcitool meshctl rfcomm sdptool)
- CHG: Refactor MQTT listener; removed blocking event
- WARNING: [BLE device possible overheating](https://github.com/tesla-local-control/tesla-local-control-addon/issues/27) causing performance issues

#### Upgrade Instructions & **BREAKING CHANGES**
- **Before update** save your configuration values (VIN, MAC address and MQTT values)
- You will need to adjust your configuration
- Now supports **list** of VINS and MAC addresses.
- Paste your current vin to vin_list, if you own more than 1 Tesla add them all!
- Paste your current mac_addr to mac_addr_list (optional for presence detection)
- Paste your MQTT values
- Existing **entities** from v0.0.10f will not be affected with a few exceptions***

#### Entities renamed

<p>For consistency, moving foward entity name uses only alphadigits and as a seperator - (no more _).<br>
/!\ It will affect your current Home Assistant MQTT entities (if you use them)></p>

   | Old Entity Name   | New Entity Name          |
   |:------------------|:-------------------------|
   | auto_seat-climate | auto-seat-and-climate    |
   | flash_lights      | flash-lights             |
   | heated_seat_left  | heater-seat-front-left*  |
   | heated_seat_right | heater-seat-front-right* |
   | sw_heater         | steering-wheel-heater    |
   \* in preparation "someday" for rear seats
