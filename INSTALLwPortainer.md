# Deploy using Portainer
It is assumed that Docker and Portainer are already setup and working.
<br /><br />
There are two options for deployment using Portainer:
<br /><br />
## 1 - Deploy using Dockerfile via Portainer
This is for those who can't (or don't want to) use the pre-built images from Dockerhub. For example you may have an architecture for which there is no image on Dockerhub.
See this document for instructions: [INSTALLwPortDFile.md](INSTALLwPortDFile.md)
<br /><br />
## 2 - Deploy using docker-compose.yml via Portainer - recommended
This will be the preferred option for most people who are using Portainer.
<br /><br />
i. Login to your Portainer instance. Select the Environment where the deployment will be made
<br /><br />
ii. Select the 'Volumes' link from the left menu. Click the blue '+ Add volume' button. In the Create volume page, enter `tesla_ble_mqtt` in the Name field and press the blue 'Create the volume' button:
